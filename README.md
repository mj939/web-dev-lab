LAB WORK DESCRIPTION:  

In this lab, we practiced using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. We created a new repository, 
initialized it with a README file, and managed files using Git commands. Key tasks included creating and switching branches, making commits, 
merging branches via pull requests, and collaborating by forking and contributing to a partnerâ€™s repository.
